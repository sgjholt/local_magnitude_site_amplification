# Local Magnitude Site Amplification Study

This repo contains source code that uses Boore's method of stochastic waveform simulation to interrogate the effects that site amplification has on local magnitudes. Calibaration of local magnitude scales typically consider site effects as Magnitude-independent constants that effectivly account for the 'boosting' of seismic signals due to near-surface signal reverberations. 
However, when we simulate earthquakes over a range of magnitudes, and for variable source-properties, we see that this effect is highly dependented on the earthquake source, suggesting classic site corrections are inadqauate for moderate-large sized earthquakes. 

## Notes
This code has not been tested or verified against the publication which documents the results, and so it is possible this code is out of date. Therefore, you may obtain different results to those in the publication if you attempt to replicate the results. I have since learned how to create data science software that allows for repeatable and reproduceable results!
